# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS. 

Projects 

Tour the Enterprise Site (project) 

This page is an example home page for a Tour of the Enterprise company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, images, containers, and a form. There is also second site (One-Page Website) which is a gallery page which models off of the style of Tour the Enterprise but this one is in regards to sharks. 

Movie Theater Site (bootstrap4_project)

This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
