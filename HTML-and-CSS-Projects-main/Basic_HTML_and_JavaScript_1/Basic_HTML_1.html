	<h1><b><u>Let's learn about some some Goblin Sharks!</b></u></h1>
	<h3>Goblin sharks dwell within the deep sea so, not much is known regarding their behavior.</h3>

	<blockquote>According to nationalgeographic.com, "Goblin sharks are a species of fish that 
	usually live at the bottom of the ocean along continental shelves (or a continent's edges). 
	These pink animals can grow 12 feet long and weigh up to 460 pounds. They have 
	narrow snouts and fanglike teeth.Spotted mostly off the coast of Japan, 
	theyâ€™re named for their likeness to mythical 
	goblins that appear in Japanese folklore."</blockquote>
